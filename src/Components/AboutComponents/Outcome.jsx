                <p> The increase of the proportion of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has various risks. To start off, it might increase a plant’s canopy size and density, thus leading to a greater biomass of high nutritional quantity, which promotes plant diseases like rust powdery mildews, leaf spots, and blight. Also, it causes a sharp ascendance in the percentage of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, leading to global warming – one of the most disastrous atrocities of today’s world. The mere presence of an increase in UV rays in today’s world is able to cause skin cancer, eye problems ,and the consistent melting of glaciers. Not to mention, the increase in plant diseases will yield an increase in animal harm, thus it will cause a plethora of nutritional risks on humans. A greater increase of global warming can even lead to water shortages, since the process of evaporation will occur at a quicker pace, drying up the world’s water sources.</p>
