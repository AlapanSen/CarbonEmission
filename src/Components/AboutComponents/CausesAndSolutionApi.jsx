        cause:"Transportation plays a significant role in the rise of carbon emissions. Automobiles – including cars, ships, trains, and planes altogether release humongous amounts of carbon dioxide every single time they are utilized",
        solution:"Cycling or walkimg for short distances, carpooling with friends during a gathering"

        title:"Human Activity",
        cause:"The mere act of utilizing energy releases enormous amouns of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, thus contributing to a sharp increase in air pollution. Burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) is the number one reason why carbon emissions keep on multiplying every single decade",
        solution:"Burn an adequate, non-excessive amounts to meet the need fr energy - after making strict laws on the conservation of resources to limit the need for fossil fuels"

        title:"Excessive Industrialization",
        cause:": Eradicating agricultural land for the sake of building factories and industries can be best described as the act of simply reducing oxygen by carbon dioxide – a great step down in the ladder of reaching a wholly Earth-friendly atmosphere. By eradicating agricultural land, we eradicate the oxygen given to us by vegetation for the sake of the carbon dioxide released to us by the chimneys and other machines used in the factory. In other words, we replace the pot of medicine with a pot of liquefied virus.",
        solution:"use environmental-friendly equipment/gadgets in an industry Plant alternative grassy lands or expand already existing ones to balance out.Recycle"

    {
        title:"Home appliances",
        cause:": Refrigerators, heating systems , and lighting systems used in almost all the houses issue a threat to the environment by boosting the level of carbon dioxide in the surrounding environment. In simple terms, those appliances solely require gigantic amounts of energy – the energy attained from the burning of fossil fuels. Eventually, humans are pushed to  burn more fossil fuels (which threatens the purity of the gaseous components of air) to develop gadgets that will release its carbon impurities to the atmosphere.",
        solution:"use environmental friendly lightbulbs, do not overstuff a fridge and store in a cold place use energy saving models for your appliances, consistently do maintenance and repair rather than replace."

        title:"Electricity:",
        cause:"As we all know, electricity is acquired from sources such as electric power plants, water dams, combustion of gases, nuclear fission, and much more. Putting aside hydroelectricity (electricity developed from water) all other sources put the environment in peril. Since we cannot solely depend on water, other sources are the main developers of electricity, thus forcing us to use an impure source (since electricity is one of the most crucial innovations of this age) to develop almost all the technology around us.",
        solution:": Exploit renewable resources in the construction of power plants, they release no greenhouse gases and burn no fuel."
