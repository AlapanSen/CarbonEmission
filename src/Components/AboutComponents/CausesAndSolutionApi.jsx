By eradicating agricultural land, we eradicate the oxygen given to us by vegetation for the sake of the carbon dioxide released to us by the chimneys and other machines used in the factory. In other words, we replace the pot of medicine with a pot of liquefied virus.",

In simple terms, those appliances solely require gigantic amounts of energy – the energy attained from the burning of fossil fuels. Eventually, humans are pushed to  burn more fossil fuels (which threatens the purity of the gaseous components of air) to develop gadgets that will release its carbon impurities to the atmosphere.",

Putting aside hydroelectricity (electricity developed from water) all other sources put the environment in peril. Since we cannot solely depend on water, other sources are the main developers of electricity, thus forcing us to use an impure source (since electricity is one of the most crucial innovations of this age) to develop almost all the technology around us.",
